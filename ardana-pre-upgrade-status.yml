# Top-level Ardana pre-upgrade status playbook
# A separate pre-upgrade status is required to account for parts of a
# service not yet deployed as part of the upgrade, e.g. the introduction of
# of the object-reconstructor service in Ardana OpenStack.
# Another possible solution is to implement a check that handles the fact
# that a service has not been deployed yet (e.g. not registered with
# systemd). For the majority of cases, the pre-upgrade status check is
# identical to the regular status check.
# BUG 2913 used to track an alternative solution.
