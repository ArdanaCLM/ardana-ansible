warning:
  openstack: >
    The current playbook is designed to be run from
    ~/openstack/ardana/ansible. If you run it from an alternative
    directory, the results could be unpredictable.
  deploy: >
    Deployments should be run from the ansible directory
    under {{ git_operations.ansible_target_dir }}/next.
    The configuration processor output is not available to
    Ansible playbooks run from another location.

    In order to run a deployment, run the configuration
    processor first using
    "ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml";
    then ready the deployment directory structure using
    "ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml".
