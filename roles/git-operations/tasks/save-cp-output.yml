# Tentatively save the output from a successful CP run.
#
# We don't yet know if this CP output is going to be used or not,
# since the user may want to refine their configuration prior to actually
# running a deployment; nonetheless, the output must be retained.
#
# Therefore, we unconditionally copy the cp-persistent state to a new, transient
# branch: staging-cp-persistent
# Similarly, we unconditionally copy the ansible output to a new, transient
# staging-ansible branch.
# (Any old branches with thes names are deleted).
#
# Parameters:
#   repo: ~/ardana
#   target_dir: ~/cp-run (subdirs of this used as work dirs)
#   branches:
#     staging-sp-persistent:
#       - from: some relative path
#         to: some relative path
#       - ... etc ...
#     staging-ansible:
#       - ... etc ...
