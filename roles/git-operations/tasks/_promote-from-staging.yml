# Promote saved branches from staging
#
# At this stage, the CP persistent state we have is about to gain
# real-world semantics: it's going to be made 'live' by a deployment.
# Promote staging-cp-persistent and staging-ansible to the top of the
# cp-persistent and ansible branches, respectively.
# These cherry-picks should be accepted unconditionally.
# The staging-* branches are then deleted.
# (We don't want to do this part twice: in the eventuality that the
# user is picking up a deployment that stumbled from a midway point,
# we ensure this step is idempotent.)
#
# Parameters:
#   repo: ~/ardana
#   work_dir: ~/.ardana
#   merge_msg: "Your message goes here"
#   branches:
#     - from: staging-cp-persistent
#       to: cp-persistent
#     - from: staging-ansible
#       to: cp-ansible
