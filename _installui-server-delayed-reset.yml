# During the install process, the installer-server is loaded up with some
# default configuration settings, including a localhost reference for
# the ardana-service on which it depends. After a deployment the ardana-service
# is no longer accessible on localhost. The url is updated via a call
# to installui-reconfigure near the end of the site.yml playbook, but
# the installer-server doesn't pickup that change until the server is
# restarted, either with a systemctl restart installer-server  or
# by calling its restart endpoint (done below)
# due to timing concerns this must be delayed at least as long as the
# ardana-service restart is delayed, ideally a bit longer

# hosts must be ARD-SVC to have access to the host.bind vars
